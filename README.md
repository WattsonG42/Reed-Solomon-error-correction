# Reed-Solomon-error-correction
Math project from high school, thought it share. Its in Norwegian though :/

This document is a pedagogical*[1] walkthrough of how Reed-Solomon codes work, providing the bare minimum mathematical background with some examples. It starts with Galois fields, polynomials, and Lagrange interpolation. Then wraps it all up with showing how it encodes -> transmits -> and recovers messages even in the presence of errors. Its made to be as accessible as possible but requires some high school level mathematics+ to fully grasp

*[1] im no teacher i just say stuff, pedagogical is a buzzword.
